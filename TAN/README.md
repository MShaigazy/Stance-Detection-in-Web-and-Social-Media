# Here is the code for TAN, LSTM and LSTM+SVM
### Different classes for different models
*networks.py* file contains the codes for different networks - <br>
* TAN : LSTM_TAN class (called with version = 0 for for basic TAN)<br>
* LSTM : LSTM_TAN class (called with version = 2)<br>
* LSTM-SVM - LSTM_TAN_svm_features class (called with version = 2)<br><br>

### Running the code
To run the code you have to run *get_training_plots.py* or *early_stopping_training.py*<br>
To change models, call the classes with specific versions as mentioned above<br>
